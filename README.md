## Introduction and Overview of Project                                                                                                                 
A Recommender system is a type of information filtering system that suggests items based on what the user is most interested in. Recommender systems are particularly useful when a person wants to select an item from a service's possible overwhelming selection of items, based on ratings and reviews of other users or finding similar content as per their interest.                                                                  
Recommender systems usually make use of either or both collaborative filtering and content-based filtering.                                         
Collaborative filtering approaches build a model from a user's past behaviour as well as similar decisions made by other users. This model is then used to predict items (or ratings for items) that the user may have an interest in.                                          
Content-based filtering approaches utilise a series of discrete, pre-tagged characteristics of an item to recommend additional items with similar properties. Recommender systems are a useful alternative to search algorithms since they help users discover items they might not have found otherwise. Of note, recommender systems are often implemented using search engines indexing non-traditional data.                                               

The approaches to Recommender Systems can be broadly categorised as â€“                                                                                 

Collaborative Filtering (CF): In CF systems, a user is given recommendations for items based on the average past ratings of all users.                          
Content-based recommendation: In this approach, recommended items are similar in content to items the user has liked in the past or matched to attributes of the user.
Hybrid approaches: This method combines both collaborative and content-based approaches.
